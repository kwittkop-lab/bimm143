## PBD statistics 

The Protein Data bank (PDB) is the main repository of biomolecular structutres. Let's see what it contains. 

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}

Dataexp<-read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")

```

```{r}
library(readr)
Dataexp<-read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
XrayEm<-sum(c(Dataexp$`X-ray`,Dataexp$EM))

(XrayEm/sum(Dataexp$Total))*100


```
 93.7892% 

The commas in these numbers leads to the numbers here being read as characters. 

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
Dataexp
sum(Dataexp[1,9]) / sum(Dataexp$Total) * 100

```
85.96889% 

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

skipped

## Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

We can use Molstar viewer online : https://molstar.org/viewer/

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

the Hydrogen atoms are not shown, only the oxygen atom is shown. 


> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH 308 

>Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

## Introduction to Bio3D in R

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

128 

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

HOH (127) 

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2 chains 

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
head(pdb$atom)

```

```{r}
#library(bio3dview)
#library(NGLVieweR)

#view.pdb(pdb) |>
  #setSpin()
```

```{r}

#sele <- atom.select(pdb, resno=25)

#view.pdb(pdb, cols=c("navy","teal"), 
        # highlight = sele,
        # highlight.style = "spacefill") |>
  #setRock()
```


## Predicting functional motions of a single structure
```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```
```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

write out our results with a trajectory/movie of predicted motions 
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")

```


## Comparative Analysis with PCA 

First step - find an ADK sequence 

```{r}
library(bio3d)
id <- "1ake_A"
aa <- get.seq(id)
```


```{r}
aa 
```


```{r}
blast <- blast.pdb(aa)
hits <-plot(blast)
```

All the Blast Results are for us to see 


The "top hits" 

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

```{r}
#download related pdb files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

These look like a hot mess 
![](1AKE-1E4V-1E4Y-3GMT-3HPR-3X2S-4K46-4PZL-5EJE-6HAM-6HAP-6RZE-6S36.png)


Next we will use `pdbaln()` function to align and also optionally fit (superpose) the identified PDB structures. 

This requires a bioconductor package called "msa" that we need to install 

First we install BiocManager. We use `BiocManager::install("msa")`


```{r}
# Align related PDBs 
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

Have a wee peak at this new alignment object `pdbs` 

```{r}
pdbs
```

We could view these in R with **Bio3Dviewer** `view.pbs()` function 

```{r}
#library(bio3dview)
#view.pdbs(pdbs, colorScheme = "residue")
```

## PCA 

we can run PCA on our PDBs object using the `pca()` function from **bio3d** 

```{r}

pc.xray<-pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
plot(pc.xray, 1:2)
```

We can make a visualization of the major conformational difference (I.e large scale structure change) aquired by or PCA analysis with the `mktrj()` function 

```{r}
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")

```

Lets do the molstar
